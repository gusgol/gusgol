👋 Hi, I'm a **Software Engineer** based in Brazil with 15+ years of experience in software development and digital products creation. 

These are the top 5 things I'm most proud about my career:

- 10+ years of **Android Development** experience: I witnessed the many revolutions this platform has been through. From the bloated architecture-less activities to Compose-MVx-Clean, I've seen a bit of everything throughout the years. One thing never changed: there is always something new to learn.

- 4 years of **managing** other engineers at TownSq and HelloFresh: accomplishing things feels great, but being an instrument for other people to achieve their objectives is even better. As the engineering manager of more than 30 software developers over these years, their feedback humbles me when they say I had a positive impact on their careers and personal lives.

- Activelly participated in product and design decisions: making people's lives easier is why we are here in the first place, right? One of the best parts of working in this creative industry is to see ideas that sparked in your mind becoming reality.

- Transformed teams, organizations, processes: fixing things that get in the way of effiency, safety, and results, has also been a great source of satisfaction. The many cycles I worked as a **Scrum Master**, and the proximity with my managers and CEO, allowed me to give vent to these aspirations.

- Contributions to other platforms: iOS, web, backend, mobile cross-platform - I confess, not every stack gets me excited. But count on me in order to complete the sprint or to cover your vacations.

👋 Hi, I'm a **Software Engineer** based in Brazil with 15+ years of experience in software development and digital products creation. 

- 10+ years of Android Development experience. Over the past decade, I have been a witness to the many transformations and advancements of the Android platform. From the initial architecture-less activities to the introduction of Compose-MVx-Clean, I have been actively monitoring and adapting to the platform’s evolution.

- 4 years of managing software engineers. Managed over 30 developers across several different teams (cross-platform and also mobile focused) and organization topologies, focusing on their professional growth and achieving project goals.

- Driving transformation in teams, organizations, and processes. As a Scrum Master in various teams and projects, led initiatives to improve efficiency and safety by identifying and removing obstacles. Collaborated closely with managers and the CEO to drive change and enhance processes.

- Contributions to various platforms. While my primary expertise is in mobile development (especially Android), I have worked across all layers of modern software products, including iOS, web, backend, and even cross-platform mobile development.
